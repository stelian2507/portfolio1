      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      At first, we made a digital survey using Google Forms, in order to find
      Quantitative data that backed up our initial premise. In this opportunity,
      we found that most of our subjects were in the youth age group (15–24)
      seeking better academic opportunities and over 70% of them found the
      process difficult. As useful as this information might be, it is very
      important, especially for a UX designer to go deeper and empathize with
      the user. We know that they find it difficult but we need to discover the
      actual reason. This is why we complemented our numeric discoveries with
      Qualitative research by interviewing our subjects.

      <h2>Final Results</h2>
      <p>
        Our study shows that a simple webpage using these three concepts can
        enhance an immigrant's experience. The Immigration process is definitely
        one of the many wicked problems we have out there. But just like any
        other bad experience, with a design thinking process that places users
        as their first priority, It can be solved.
