      Project description At first, we made a digital survey using Google Forms,
      in order to find Quantitative data that backed up our initial premise. In
      this opportunity, we found that most of our subjects were in the youth age
      group (15–24) seeking better academic opportunities and over 70% of them
      found the process difficult. As useful as this information might be, it is
      very important, especially for a UX designer to go deeper and empathize
      with the user. We know that they find it difficult but we need to discover
      the actual reason. This is why we complemented our numeric discoveries
      with Qualitative research by interviewing our subjects.

      <p>Final Results Our study shows that a simple webpage using these three
      concepts can enhance an immigrant's experience. The Immigration process is
      definitely one of the many wicked problems we have out there. But just
      like any other bad experience, with a design thinking process that places
      users as their first priority, It can be solved.</p>
